# Codename : Photoposh

## General Presentation :
This repo is a group project for the last year of my high school computer science group. 
The goal of this project is to allow editing of any image format by using the Bitmap format for modifications (which was imposed on us).
The use of modules is only tolerated for functionalities that are not related to image editing, so we will make ample use of them for everything that surrounds the heart of our project.

## Rules : 
-	Modules allowed if not used for image modifications
-	Image modification must not use modules

## Tools : 
- ❓ [BMP Explanations (Detailed)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BMP_file_format)
- 🛠️ [HXD (Hexadecimal Editor)](https://mh-nexus.de/en/downloads.php?product=HxD20)
